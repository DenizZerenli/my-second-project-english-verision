# my second project english verision
In the English version of my project, I have made it more understandable for our non-Turkish friends and acquaintances, and student names have been changed. Some Turkish characters have been used in certain places; please excuse the inconvenience (the Turkish characters used are sınav1(exam1),sınav2 (exam2),sınav3 (exam3), sınav4 (exam4), and sonuç (result)).
